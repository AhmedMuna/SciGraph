SciGraph
========

A Neo4j backed ontology store.

You can run local copy (you'll need git, Maven, and java 7) by running the following:

    curl -L http://goo.gl/RBonro | sh

This will download a recent copy of the Monarch graph (about 5GB unzipped),
clone the git repository, build the project, and finally start the server
running. Point your browser to
[http://localhost:9000/scigraph/docs/](http://localhost:9000/scigraph/docs/)
 to get started.
